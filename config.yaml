  THE PROPERTY — Maple Creek Mixed-Use Center

  You are a junior analyst at a commercial real estate
  investment firm. Your team is evaluating the acquisition
  of Maple Creek Mixed-Use Center, a neighborhood property
  combining retail and residential uses in a mid-sized
  suburban market.

  PROPERTY COMPOSITION
  • Ground-floor retail: 18,000 SF GLA (two tenants)
  • Upper level: 20 apartment units

  RETAIL TENANTS
  Tenant              Space SF  Rent/SF  Escal.   Term    % Rent
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  GreenMart (Anchor)  15,000   $20.00   3.0%/yr  5 yrs   2% > $10M
  Brew & Bean Coffee   3,000   $28.00   2.5%/yr  5 yrs   None

  RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT
  • 20 units at $1,500/month per unit
  • Rent growth: 3.0% annually
  • Apartment vacancy: 5.0%

  KEY LEASE PROVISIONS
  • Percentage Rent (GreenMart): 2% of gross sales above
    $10,000,000 breakpoint. Current sales: $9M/yr growing
    at 3%. No percentage rent currently owed.
  • Co-Tenancy (Brew & Bean): Rent reduced 50% if EITHER:
    (a) GreenMart ceases to operate, OR
    (b) apartment occupancy falls below 80%.
    Currently NOT active.

  OPERATING & VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS
  Assumption                         Year 1     Growth
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Credit Loss (% of Gross Income)    2.0%       —
  Ancillary Income (parking, etc.)   $12,000    2.0%
  Total Operating Expenses           $95,000    2.5%
  Management Fee (% Rental Inc.)     5.0%       —
  Required Rate of Return            9.0%       —
  Exit Cap Rate                      7.0%       —

  VALUATION METHOD — Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
  Property Value = PV of NOI (Years 1–5)
                 + PV of Terminal Value
  Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
  This assumes NOI is stabilized at Year 5 with NO
  further growth beyond the hold period.
  Discount all cash flows at the Required Rate of Return.

  YOUR TASK (BASE CASE)
  Build a 5-year operating pro forma. Then compute the
  DCF valuation by discounting the NOI and terminal
  value at the required return.

initial_questions:
  - "What is the Year 1 NOI? What proportion comes from retail vs. residential income?"
  - "What is the indicated property value using DCF? How much of the value comes from the terminal value vs. operating cash flows?"
  - "How does NOI trend over the 5-year hold? What drives the growth?"
  - "What advantages and risks does a mixed-use property offer compared to pure retail or pure residential?"

    info: |
      MARKET UPDATE — Round 1: Percentage Rents Kick In

      The local economy is booming. GreenMart reports
      significantly higher sales:

      • Year 1 gross sales revised to $11,000,000 (from $9M)
      • Sales growth revised to 4.0% (from 3%)
      • All other assumptions unchanged

      Reminder: Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
      (no NOI growth assumed beyond Year 5).
    questions:
      - "How much percentage rent does GreenMart owe in Year 1? How does it grow over 5 years?"
      - "What is the new Year 1 NOI and DCF property value? Calculate the change from the Base Case ($ and %)."
      - "Why is percentage rent valuable to a landlord? What are the risks if it becomes a large share of income?"
      - "Would you prefer higher base rent with no percentage rent, or lower base rent with generous overage provisions?"

      MARKET UPDATE — Round 2: A New Competitor Arrives

      A developer announces a 50,000 SF retail center one
      mile away with a competing grocery chain.

      • GreenMart sales revised to $8,500,000, growth 1.0%
      • Apartment vacancy rises to 10.0%
        (occupancy 90%, still above 80% co-tenancy threshold)
      • Exit cap rate widens to 7.5%
      • Required rate of return: 9.0% (unchanged)
      • All other assumptions unchanged from Round 1

      Reminder: Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
      (no NOI growth assumed beyond Year 5).
    questions:
      - "What happens to percentage rents?"
      - "Calculate the new NOI and DCF value. What is the change from Round 1 ($ and %)?"
      - "The exit cap rate moved only 50 bps (7.0% → 7.5%), yet value fell significantly. Explain why."
      - "How does the residential component partially insulate the property?"
      - "What proactive steps could the owner take to protect value?"
      - "Do you believe other teams in the class will arrive at the same valuation as you? Why or why not?"
    private_info:
      group1: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your team's research indicates the
        competing grocery chain has a pattern of significant
        construction delays — their last three projects opened
        12–18 months behind schedule. Local brokers believe
        GreenMart will retain most of its customer base during
        this window.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Forecast Gross Sales of
          $9,000,000 (instead of $8,500,000).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group2: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your leasing team has learned that
        several apartment tenants plan to vacate when their
        leases expire, citing anticipated construction noise
        from the new development. The property manager expects
        vacancy to exceed the market consensus.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Apartment Vacancy Rate of
          15.0% (instead of 10.0%).
          Note: check whether occupancy still clears the
          80% co-tenancy threshold.
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group3: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Through an industry contact, your team
        has learned the competing developer's financing fell
        through last week. They are scrambling for a new lender
        and there is a meaningful probability the project stalls
        or is cancelled entirely. Without the competitive
        threat, risk should not have increased.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use an Exit Cap Rate of 7.0%
          (unchanged from Round 1, instead of 7.5%).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group4: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your team has obtained intelligence that
        GreenMart is in active negotiations for a lease renewal
        at a higher rent. Responding to the competitive threat,
        they want exclusivity protections in exchange for a
        premium above their current rate.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Anchor Base Rent of $22/SF
          (instead of $20/SF).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group5: |

        ANALYST NOTE: A reliable source on the city planning
        commission indicates the competing development site has
        a newly discovered environmental issue — underground
        storage tanks from a former gas station. Remediation
        will delay the project by 2+ years. During that window,
        GreenMart's sales should grow faster than the market
        expects.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Annual Sales Growth of 2.0%
          (instead of 1.0%).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group6: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your banking contacts report that lenders
        are becoming cautious about retail exposure in this
        submarket. Two recent loan applications for nearby
        retail properties were rejected, and institutional
        buyers are demanding higher returns.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use an Exit Cap Rate of 8.0%
          (instead of 7.5%).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group7: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your market research team has completed
        a consumer survey showing that 30% of GreenMart
        shoppers would switch to the new competitor. However,
        foot traffic from the new center could actually
        benefit the residential units — several prospective
        tenants mentioned the additional retail as a draw.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Apartment Vacancy Rate of
          7.0% (instead of 10.0%).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.
      group8: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your team has obtained a draft copy of
        the competing center's tenant roster. It includes a
        discount grocer, not a full-service chain — a weaker
        competitive threat than the market assumes. GreenMart's
        sales impact should be more modest.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Forecast Gross Sales of
          $9,500,000 (instead of $8,500,000) and Annual
          Sales Growth of 2.0% (instead of 1.0%).
          All other Round 2 assumptions unchanged.

    info: |
      MARKET UPDATE — Round 3: Local Economic Shock

      MegaCorp Manufacturing (2,500 employees) announces
      it will close its local plant within 90 days.

      • GreenMart sales revised to $7,000,000
        Sales now DECLINING at 2% per year
      • Apartment vacancy surges to 25%
        Occupancy = 75%
      • Credit loss rises to 4.0%
      • Exit cap rate widens to 8.5%
      • Required rate of return rises to 10.0%

      KEY INSIGHT: Apartment occupancy has dropped
      BELOW 80%, triggering Brew & Bean's co-tenancy
      clause. Their rent is reduced by 50% — even though
      GreenMart is still operating.

      Reminder: Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
      (no NOI growth assumed beyond Year 5).
    questions:
      - "What is the new NOI and DCF property value?"
      - "Track the cumulative decline from the Base Case. What % of value has been lost?"
      - "The co-tenancy clause was triggered by apartment vacancy, not the anchor leaving. Why would a coffee shop care about apartment occupancy?"
      - "Decompose the value change: how much is from NOI decline vs. exit cap rate widening vs. the higher discount rate?"
      - "Do you think every team in the class will value this property the same way? What might cause different teams to reach different conclusions?"
    private_info:
      group1: |

        ANALYST NOTE: A contact at GreenMart's regional office
        confides that headquarters is reviewing underperforming
        locations for potential closure. Maple Creek is on the
        watch list. Your team believes the sales outlook is
        significantly worse than the market assumes.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Annual Sales Growth of -5.0%
          (instead of -2.0%).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group2: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your property management team reports
        a local tech startup with 50 employees has signed
        letters of intent for 4 apartment units, partially
        offsetting the vacancy surge. Your team believes
        actual vacancy will be lower than market consensus.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Apartment Vacancy Rate of
          20.0% (instead of 25.0%).
          Note: carefully check whether occupancy at 80%
          triggers the co-tenancy clause (threshold is
          BELOW 80%).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group3: |

        ANALYST NOTE: A municipal planning contact has shared
        that the city is fast-tracking a tax increment financing
        (TIF) district that includes Maple Creek. Property tax
        abatements will significantly reduce operating costs
        starting Year 1.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Total Operating Expenses of
          $75,000 (instead of $95,000).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group4: |

        ANALYST NOTE: A competing investor group has toured
        Maple Creek and is reportedly preparing a lowball bid.
        Your contacts suggest institutional buyers now view
        this submarket as significantly riskier than the
        current 8.5% cap rate implies.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use an Exit Cap Rate of 9.5%
          (instead of 8.5%).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group5: |

        ANALYST NOTE: The state has announced a $20M economic
        development grant to attract a replacement employer to
        the MegaCorp site. Early reports indicate strong
        interest from a logistics company. Consumer spending
        is holding up better than feared.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Forecast Gross Sales of
          $7,500,000 (instead of $7,000,000).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group6: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your credit analysis team has reviewed
        the remaining tenants and believes the property's
        credit exposure is overstated. GreenMart has a strong
        corporate guarantee, and residential tenants are mostly
        on 12-month leases with security deposits.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Credit Loss of 3.0%
          (instead of 4.0%).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group7: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your team has learned that a regional
        hospital system is expanding and plans to lease office
        space near Maple Creek. The added daytime foot traffic
        should support GreenMart's sales above the current
        pessimistic forecast, and residential demand should
        hold up better than the market expects.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use Forecast Gross Sales of
          $7,500,000 (instead of $7,000,000) and Apartment
          Vacancy Rate of 20.0% (instead of 25.0%).
          Note: carefully check whether occupancy at 80%
          triggers the co-tenancy clause (threshold is
          BELOW 80%).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.
      group8: |

        ANALYST NOTE: Your contacts in local government report
        that two additional employers are considering layoffs
        in the next quarter. The economic shock may be deeper
        and longer than the market currently anticipates.
        Investors are pulling back from the submarket.

        ➤ ADJUST YOUR MODEL: Use an Exit Cap Rate of 9.0%
          (instead of 8.5%) and Apartment Vacancy Rate of
          30.0% (instead of 25.0%).
          All other Round 3 assumptions unchanged.

      MARKET UPDATE — Round 4: The Anchor Goes Dark

      GreenMart ceases operations immediately.
      The store goes dark.

      • GreenMart's 15,000 SF is VACANT
        $0 rent, $0 sales, no percentage rents
      • Set Anchor Operating to 0 (No)
      • Apartment vacancy worsens to 30%
      • Credit loss rises to 5%
      • Exit cap rate widens to 10.0%
      • Required rate of return rises to 12.0%
      • Operating expenses remain unchanged —
        the landlord still pays all costs

      Reminder: Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
      (no NOI growth assumed beyond Year 5).
    questions:
      - "What is the Year 1 NOI? Is it positive or negative? What keeps the property afloat?"
      - "A pure retail property would have produced a negative NOI. What does this teach about income diversification?"
      - "Explain 'going dark' and the purpose of co-tenancy clauses."

      MARKET UPDATE — Round 5: Leverage & Tax Status

      The property has been re-leased and the economy
      has modestly recovered.

      • New anchor at $20/SF (same terms as original)
        Co-tenancy no longer active
      • Apartment vacancy: 8%
      • Credit loss: 3%
      • Exit cap rate: 7.5%
      • Required rate of return: 9.0%
      • All other assumptions revert to original

      Reminder: Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
      (no NOI growth assumed beyond Year 5).

      PART A — DEBT SERVICE ANALYSIS

      DEBT TERMS
      • LTV: 65%
      • Interest Rate: 6.5% fixed
      • Amortization: 30 years

      Add below NOI in your pro forma:
      Loan Amount (Value × LTV)
      Debt Service (=PMT)
      BTCF (NOI − Debt Service)
      DSCR (NOI ÷ Debt Service)
      Cash-on-Cash (BTCF ÷ Equity)

      THEN: Rates rise to 8.0%.
      Recalculate all debt metrics.

      PART B — TAX STATUS COMPARISON

      Two buyers are interested: a taxable corporation
      and a tax-exempt pension fund.

      • Building = 80% of value (land = 20%)
      • Depreciation: straight-line over 39 years
      • Taxable rate: 25%
      • Year 1 interest ≈ Loan × Rate
      • Pension fund rate: 0%
      • Use 6.5% debt terms from Part A

      Compute for each investor type:
      Depreciation
      Taxable Income (NOI − Depreciation − Interest)
      Tax
      After-Tax Cash Flow (ATCF)
    questions:
      - "What is the DCF property value? Does adding debt change the property's value?"
      - "What is the DSCR at 6.5%? Is the property financeable (lenders typically require DSCR > 1.25x)?"
      - "What is the cash-on-cash return vs. the unlevered 9.0% required return? Explain the difference."
      - "When rates rise to 8.0%, what happens to DSCR and cash-on-cash? Why are rising rates particularly dangerous for leveraged real estate?"
      - "What is the annual depreciation? What is the ATCF for the taxable investor vs. the pension fund?"
      - "The pension fund earns ≈$23,000/year more in after-tax cash flow. How might this affect what each investor is willing to pay for the same property?"

  round6:
    title: "Reposition or Redevelop?"

      MARKET UPDATE — Round 6: Reposition or Redevelop?

      The market has softened further.
      Evaluate three strategic options.

      CURRENT DEGRADED STATE
      • Anchor rent renegotiated to $14/SF
      • Apartment vacancy 25% (co-tenancy active)
      • Credit loss 5%, Exit cap rate 9.5%
      • Sales $7.5M, 0% growth
      • Required rate of return: 9.0%

      OPTION A: Continue As-Is
      Value = DCF valuation (same method as prior rounds)
      Terminal Value = Year 5 NOI ÷ Exit Cap Rate
      (no NOI growth assumed beyond Year 5).

      OPTION B: Renovate & Reposition
      $2M cost (Year 0). No income Year 1.
      NOI $650K/yr from Year 2, 3% growth.
      Terminal cap rate 6.5%.

      OPTION C: Demolish & Build Luxury Mixed-Use
      $6M cost (Year 0). No income Years 1–2.
      NOI $850K/yr from Year 3, 3% growth.
      Terminal cap rate 5.5%.

      Discount rate: 9.0% for all NPV calculations.
    questions:
      - "What is the NPV of each option? Which maximizes value?"
      - "Option C has highest terminal value but needs most capital. How should you weigh return vs. risk?"
      - "What qualitative factors might favor one option over another, even if NPV disagrees?"
